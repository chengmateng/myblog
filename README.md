# My person blog
This is my person blog.



## Workflow for editing the blog

checkout a new branch such as `myfeature` and edit new changes

Then,

``` 
Hexo clean

Hexo generate

Hexo server
```
After everything is ok

```
Hexo deploy
```
And get back to `develop` branch to merge  in the `myfeature`  branch.

If everything is good, you can also let `master` branch merge in `myfeature` branch.
